# mTLS Demo

## Description
This project serves as a demonstration of mutual TLS (mTLS) implementation. Mutual TLS is a security protocol that requires both the client and the server to authenticate each other before establishing a secure communication channel. This ensures a higher level of security compared to traditional TLS, where only the server is authenticated.
